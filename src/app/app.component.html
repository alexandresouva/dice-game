      <li>
        Each player takes turns rolling the dice until they choose to stop.
      </li>
      <li>
        On each turn, the player's score is increased by the value of the dice roll.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated in that turn, and the turn passes to the next player.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a player chooses to stop, their current score is added to their total score.
      </li>
      <li>
        The first player to reach 100 points wins!
